## community-management

Dedicated repository for managing the WEB3DEV community's internal projects.

If you want to contribute, take a look at the open issues to identify the activities listed that need collaboration.

Each project will have its own folder for management. In order to understand the work process of each project, it is recommended that every project has a document presenting the objective, key results, smart goals and the workflow of each project activity with a description of the respective roles for each one.
